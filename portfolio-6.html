      <h3>Year of The Rooster</h3>
      <p>This year is the Rooster in Chinese culture. I used traditional Chinese painting to express the Rooster. This style allows me to discover more painting skills in Illustrator by using painting brushes.</p>

      <h3>About Design</h3>
      <p>As we all know, Canada Post published postal stamps every year. Based on this year is the Year of the Rooster. So I designed this postal stamp and also made a poster to show how it looks like.</p>
