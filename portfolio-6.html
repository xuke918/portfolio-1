      <h3>Quote Book</h3>
      <p>For this quote book I chose quotes from Dr. Steve Maraboli. He is a life-changing
      Speaker, bestselling Author. The reason why I chose his quotes is because his quotes are very
      powerful and positive. Those quotes usually give people more encourage and inspiration when
      they have problems or feel upset.</p>

      <h3>About Design</h3>
      <p>For the design I chose keywords to express the quote, and have the left page all made by hand,
      right pages are all digital. For the font I chose one digital font Caflisch Script Pro semibold
      because Steve Maraboli is a good writer so I chose Script Typeface looks like handwriting.</p>
