      <p><strong>Mirror Mirror</strong> (Mobile App Design) is the app which can connect to the smart mirror at clothing store and act as a virtual change room to helping customers to choose and buy clothing quickly. For the app icon, I used letter “M” as the main focus to show the app name Mirror, Mirror. Also I combined clothes icon and letter “M” together to express that this app is using for clothing stores. </p>
